*Project Description
- When you want to go somewhere, the first thing you will check is how can you get there as quickly as possible. Sometimes we have lots of things to do and we forget about the most important thing in traveling, which is safety. How many times has this happened to you? The reason we are creating staysafe.com is to look for the best way home, but above all, for your safety. Through the users' votes, the most dangerous places are mapped so that you can travel safely.
